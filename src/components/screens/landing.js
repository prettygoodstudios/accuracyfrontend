          <p><span className="start-phrase">Our story</span> started in January of 2018. We were founded by a small group of experienced accountants who wanted to make a difference in the local community. We have more than 60 years of combined experience in the accounting services industry. Our founder, David Smith, left his position as the Chief Auditor at one of Utahâ€™s premier accounting firms in order to start Accuracy. He brought along some of his colleagues, who also happened to be seasoned accountants, in order to help him with his new venture of providing accounting services to small businesses, and since then Accuracy has expanded to serve the needs of medium sized businesses as well.</p>
